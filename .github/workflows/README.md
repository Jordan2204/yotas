# Yotas CI

We designed a certain amount of github actions for the project !
- `deploy-doc` that will build and deploy the documentation on hostme.space.
- `deploy-front` that will build and deploy the frontend on hostme.space.
- `run-end2end-test` for end to end tests on the project itself.
- `backend-lint` to format using the installed linter, the backend.
- `pull-request-check` to run backend tests on new pull requests.
